# powerball-simulator

##Description
I created a simple powerball simulator that gets 5 random numbers from 1-50 and the powerball number is from 1-20. I used the current time 
as the seed for random number generation. I then let the user choose how many players he would like to simulate for, with 100 being the max.

Honestly i just did this to for learn Python.
